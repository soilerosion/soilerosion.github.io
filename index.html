<center><p><br><b>SOIL EROSION</b></br><p></center>
<br><p><i>   Soil erosion</i> is the displacement of the upper layer of soil, one form of soil degradation. A low level of erosion of soil is a naturally occurring process on all land. The agents of soil erosion are water and wind, each contributing a significant amount of soil loss each year. Soil erosion may be a slow process that continues relatively unnoticed, or it may occur at an alarming rate causing a serious loss of topsoil. The loss of soil from farmland may be reflected in reduced crop production potential, lower surface water quality and damaged drainage networks.<p></br>
