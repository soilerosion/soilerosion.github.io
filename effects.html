<center><h1><b>WHAT ARE THE EFFECTS OF SOIL EROSION?</b></h1></center>

<br><b>1. Loss of topsoil:</b> Obviously, this is the biggest effect of soil erosion. Because topsoil is so fertile, if it is removed, this can cause serious harm to farmer's crops or the ability to effectively work their land.<p>

<br><b>2. Soil compaction:</b> When soil under the topsoil becomes compacted and stiff, it reduces the ability for water to infiltrate these deeper levels, keeping runoff at greater levels, which increases the risk of more serious erosion. <p>

<br><b>3. Reduced organic and fertile matter: </b> As mentioned, removing topsoil that is heavy with organic matter will reduce the ability for the land to regenerate new flora or crops. When new crops or plants canâ€™t be placed successfully in the area, this perpetuates a cycle of reduced levels of organic nutrients. <p>

<br><b>4. Poor drainage: </b> Sometimes too much compaction with sand can lead to an effective crust that seals in the surface layer, making it even harder for water to pass through to deeper layers. In some ways, this can help erosion because of the densely packed soil, but if it perpetuates greater levels of runoff from rainwater or flooding, it can negatively impact the crucial topsoil. <p>

<br><b>5. Issues with plant reproduction: </b> When soil is eroded in an active cropland, wind in particular makes lighter soil properties such as new seeds and seedlings to be buried or destroyed. This, in turn, impacts future crop production. <p>

<br><b>6. Soil acidity levels: </b> When the structure of the soil becomes compromised, and organic matter is greatly reduced, there is a higher chance of increased soil acidity, which will significantly impact the ability for plants and crops to grow. <p>

<br><b>Long term erosion: </b> Unfortunately, if an area is prone to erosion or has a history of it, it becomes even harder to protect it in the future. The process has already reduced the soil structure and organic matter of the area, meaning that it will be harder to recover in the long run.<p>


<br><b>Water pollution: </b> A major problem with runoff from soils - particularly those used for agricultural processes - is that there is a greater likelihood that sediment and contamination like the use of fertilizer or pesticide. This can have significant damage on fish and water quality.<p>
